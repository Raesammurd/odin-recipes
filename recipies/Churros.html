  <ul>
    <li>2 quarts vegetable oil for frying</li>
    <li>1 cup water ½ cup margar</li>
    <li>3 ½ tablespoons vegetable oil, divided</li>
    <li>½ cup margarine</li>
    <li>3 eggs ¼ cup white sugar</li>
  </ul>
  <ol>
    <li>
      In a heavy deep skillet or deep-fryer, heat oil to 360 degrees F (180
      degrees C). Oil should be about 1 1/2 inches deep.

      In a medium saucepan, heat water and margarine to a rolling boil. Combine
      the flour and salt; stir into the boiling mixture. Reduce heat to low and
      stir vigorously until the mixture forms a ball, about 1 minute. Remove
      from heat and beat in the eggs one at a time. Spoon the mixture into a
      pastry bag fitted with a large star tip.

    <li>
      Carefully squeeze out 4 inch long strips of dough directly into the hot
      oil. Fry 3 or 4 strips at once, until golden brown, about 2 minutes on
      each side. Remove from hot oil to drain on paper towels. Stir together the
      sugar and cinnamon; roll churros in the mixture while still hot.
